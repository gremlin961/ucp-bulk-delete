# UCP Bulk Delete
This script will perform bulk account modifications on Docker UCP 2.2.0 and above. By default, this script will generate a list of existing accounts on the UCP and save them in a users.json file. Uncommenting the last line of the script will then proceed with a bulk deletion of all accounts contained within the generated users.json file.
